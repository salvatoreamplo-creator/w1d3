    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul> for the Focaccia
      <li> 4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups (350g) lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan </li>
    </ul>   
    <ul> for the topping
      <li>3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil, for brushing on top</li>
      <li>10 onces brie, cut into cubes (scrape rind off whit a paring knife if desired, though it's non necessary)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh or frozen cranberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>make the focaccia dough</li>
        <P>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour...</P>
